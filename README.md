# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was centered around creating a system to help a driving school improve its services. The client, DriverPass, required a comprehensive platform that facilitates driver training, courses and scheduling appointments with instructors. The goal was to design a system that streamlines these services, ensuring ease of access for students and efficient managment for the company.

What did you do particularly well?

One area where I excelled was gathering and organizing business requirements. I effectively translated the client's needs into a structured business requirments document, ensuring clarity and thoroughness. Additionally, I believe the use case and activity diagrams were well-executed, providing a clear visual representation of system workflows and user interactions.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise one part of the project, it would be the initial system limitations section. Upon review, I noticed that the explanations lacked non-technical background. I would improve this by simplifying the language and providing examples that better illustrate the constraints.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpreting the user's needs involved regular review of the client's objectives and feedback. I focused on aligning system features, such as online scheduling and progress tracking, with the expectations of both students and instructors. Addressing user needs is crucial because it ensures the system is pratical, user-friendly and capable of solving real-world problems effectively.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to software design emphasizes iterative development and collaboration. I started by creating wireframes and prototypes to visualize the system early. In future projects, I plan to enhance my analysis phase by conducting more user interviews and employing techniques like storyboarding to capture diverse perspectives. This will help refine the design to better align with user expectations.
